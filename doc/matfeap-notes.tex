\chapter{MATFEAP basics}

\section{Introduction}

MATFEAP is an interface between MATLAB and the finite element analysis
program FEAP.  MATFEAP is meant to be a successor to FEAPMEX, an earlier
interface project which used MATLAB's MEX system for interfacing with
external codes.  MATFEAP differs from FEAPMEX primarily in that it runs
MATLAB and FEAP in different processes which communicate with each other
via either a network socket (or optionally a pipe):

\end{center}

There are several advantages to this socket-based architecture:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  The text command interface to FEAP has remained more stable
  than the internal architecture.  By building the communication between
  MATLAB and FEAP on this text interface, rather than by calling FEAP's
  internal routines directly from MATLAB, it is less difficult to keep
  MATFEAP working with multiple FEAP versions than it was to keep FEAPMEX
  working.

\item
  When debugging problems with FEAP, it is possible to run {\tt gdb},
  {\tt valgrind}, and other debugging tools directly on the FEAP
  server.  Also, if FEAP crashes, it will not take MATLAB down with
  it.

\item
  Because each FEAP simulation runs in a separate process, there are no
  issues with initializing the global segment (and all the common
  block variables that FEAP uses) on initialization, nor are there
  issues with releasing system resources on exit.  In contrast,
  getting the global FEAP initialization and shutdown right was always
  tricky with FEAPMEX.

\item
  Also because each FEAP simulation runs in a separate process, it is
  possible to have multiple FEAP simulations open simultaneously.

\item
  The FEAP server does not need to be on the same machine as the MATLAB
  client.  This could be useful for running MATLAB on a laptop or other
  ``front-end'' machine and running the FEAP server on a higher-power
  remote system.

\item
  MATFEAP does not need a MEX component.  Therefore, there are no
  issues of compatibility with the compilers used by the MEX
  interface.  Users can compile the FEAP server using the same
  compilers and flags that they use to compile FEAP, and the client
  support code needs only MATLAB and Java.

\end{itemize}

\section{Code organization}

The server code is made up of three basic modules:
\begin{itemize}
\item 
  The server daemon module is responsible for setting up a socket
  connection on the server side, setting up a new child processes to handle
  each incoming simulation request, and cleaning up the child processes
  when simulations are finished.  The call to the server module is transparent
  from the perspective of the FORTRAN code that calls it.  When the server
  module returns control to a child process, that child communicates with
  the client via its standard input and output streams, just as it would
  if the client were someone entering commands at the terminal.

\item
  The {\tt feapsrv} module provides a command line interface for accessing
  FEAP's internal state, and implements the server side of the data transfer
  protocols used by MATFEAP.  This command line interface is invoked at
  the start of each simulation, and it can be invoked during the simulation
  through a FEAP user macro.

\item
  There are several FORTRAN support routines called by {\tt feapsrv}.
  Some of these routines are simple interfaces to ordinary FEAP
  functions; the rest are modifications to FEAP functions, mostly
  automatically generated.  These FORTRAN routines serve two purposes.
  First, they let us call a few FEAP routines from {\tt feapsrv}
  without worrying about proper cross-language binding of FEAP's
  common block variables.  Second, they add synchronization messages
  to existing routines in order to make it easy for the client to tell
  when input is expected.

\end{itemize}

In addition to the FORTRAN support routines, the server is also linked to
the standard FEAP library.

The support on the client side consists of two pieces: a Java class
that manages the socket connection (there is also an optional MEX
library), and a library of MATLAB routines that manage the protocol by
which MATLAB communicates with the FEAP server.

The documentation that follows is largely automatically extracted from
specially-formatted comments in the MATFEAP source files.  The documentation
tool we use is available at

\section{Running MATFEAP}

To run a MATFEAP simulation, you have to build the {\tt feaps} (FEAP
server) executable and run it on the machine where the simulation is
to take place.  Once the FEAP server is running, start MATLAB and
execute the {\tt matfeap\_init} script to set the system paths
correctly:
\input{feapinit}

This initialization routine should work fine with MATLAB versions 7+,
including the student edition.  In MATLAB 6.5, the class path used by
MATLAB's JVM cannot be dynamically modified, so one has to set that
variable in another way -- see the Mathworks site for details.


\section{Simple example}

To give the flavor for how MATFEAP works in practice, we give a simple
example that uses several of MATFEAP's capabilities.

\chapter{Setting up the C server}

The {\tt feapserver} routine provides a fairly generic way to turn a
console-based FORTRAN program into a UNIX server daemon.  From the
perspective of the FORTRAN program, very little changes on return from
a call to {\tt feapserver}, except that the input and output terminals
are now connected to a remote client via a socket.  Ordinary FORTRAN
{\tt read} and {\tt write} statements directed to the standard output
will go over that socket.  The caller doesn't need to know anything about
the details that turn the program into a network server daemon on this
call.  However, these details and their implementation are spelled out
below.

\input{feapsock}


% ===================================================================
\chapter{The {\tt feapsrv} interface}

When running {\tt feapsrv}, the client can access most
MATFEAP-specific functions using a text-based command interface.
These include things like changing the working directory, setting FEAP
parameters, and sending or receiving FEAP's internal arrays and common
block entries.  The C code is in the driver's seat when {\tt feapsrv}
is active, though there are frequent calls back into the FORTRAN code.

\input{feapsrv}


% ===================================================================
\chapter{FORTRAN support routines}

The FORTRAN support routines really play a secondary role to the C routines.
They are almost all either modifications of existing FEAP routines or thin
wrappers over top of existing FEAP routines.  The main reason that some of
these routines exist is that it is {\em much} easier to access the FORTRAN
common block data used by FEAP directly from FORTRAN than it is to access 
it from C.

\input{feapfort}


% ===================================================================
\chapter{MATLAB client}

The MATLAB client uses a thin Java client class to manage sending and
receiving data over a pipe or TCP socket.  There is also a C-language
MEX file which can be compiled to send and receive data over a TCP or
UNIX-domain socket (this C language MEX file is required to run
MATFEAP with Octave).  Except when using the {\tt feapsrv} interface,
the protocol is that the FEAP server will send a synchronization
method whenever it is waiting for input and when it is ready to quit.
In this mode, the client does not send data except immediately after
receiving a synchronization message from FEAP.

When using the {\tt feapsrv} interface documented previously, the generic
protocol is to wait for the {\tt FEAPSRV} prompt, then send a command, then
wait for the next {\tt FEAPSRV} prompt.  However, there are more elaborate
protocols for transferring arrays between FEAP and MATLAB, and these are
documented along with the {\tt feapsrv} module.

\section{Communication performance}

Of the three communication models offered by MATFEAP, the TCP socket
communication is the most flexible (since it can connect to servers on
remote machines).  At the same time, for single-machine use, it is the
slowest of the methods.  On the UNIX and OS X boxes where I have done
tests, both the pipe communication mechanism and the UNIX-domain
socket mechanism seem to achieve reasonable performance.  The default
behavior as set in {\tt matfeap\_init} is to use UNIX-domain sockets
with the C MEX client, and pipes with the Java client.
